            Instructions:
                1. Extract and list only the side effects mentioned in the data provided.
                2. Ensure that the response should be categorized and contains only the names of the category name, such as "pain", "urinary problem", "digestive problem", "skin" etc.
                3. Do not include any other words, phrases, or explanations in the response.
                4. Each side effect should be unique. Do not list any repeated words or phrases.
                5. Exclude words that have the same or similar meanings (e.g., do not list both "fever" and "high temperature"â€”only include one).
                6. instead of index numbers of the reviews replace it with * symbol
                7. Give three values so that it tells how good the drug is for the body, I am using this for visualisation.
